# Complete flush of the LTMAS System

Flushing of the entire LTMAS cabinet should be done only when the system is completely warm. **All the three chamber temperatures are around 300 K**.

### Flushing the Dewar.

Connect a source of N<sub>2</sub> gas with pressure of about 0.5 bar to the inlet of the liquid nitrogen dewar, and open the brass vent tap in front of the Dewar. Keep this gas connected for about 30 mins. Please check that warm gas is coming out through the outlet.

### Flushing the Probe

When the flushing of the Dewar is going on, set Bearing pressure to 2000 mBar, Drive pressure to 2000 mBar and VT to 400 l/h, and put all the channels into **cooling** mode. This ensures that the warm gas passes through the lines in the chambers and removes any moistureS.

### Flush Insert/Eject

Flush insert and eject lines without the sample catcher connected for about a minute. This is done by doing a few insert eject cycles without a rotor. After the flushing of the Dewar is done, flush the insert/eject for a minute.

### Flushing chambers
Log in as admin, and go to the configuration mode. In the manual option, fill the chambers and close the filling valve. Check that the pressure does not drop. This indicates that there is no leak etc in the chambers.

After that fill to 3.5-4 bar and vent until the pressure is about 0.5 bar. Do not go below 0.5 bar as there is a risk of air being pumped back into the chambers. Repeat the _fill-vent_ cycle 10 times.

### Flushing lines in the chamber.
In the admin mode, put the valves to cooling mode and pass 20 l/min nitrogen gas on all three lines for about 5 mins.


After flushing the lines, put the valves to bypass mode, reduce flows to be about 5 l/min on all lines. 

The Dewar is ready to be filled, and system is ready to be cooled down.

Do not forget to fill chambers at the end.
