To shim a magnet please perform the follwing:
1. At room temperature, put an adamantane rotor and spin at about 5 kHz.
2. Type 'bsmsdisp' on Topspin and click on the tab 'shim'.
3. Click on the coil you want to modify the current on, and use the mouse wheel to change the values. You can increase the steps to make the process less tedious.
4. The adamantane lines should be less than 5 Hz in FWHM and should have a Lorentzian/Gaussian line shape.

Tips:

- Try in this order, Z, ZX, ZY, X, Y, XYZ.
- If the shape is terrible, try $Z^2$.
