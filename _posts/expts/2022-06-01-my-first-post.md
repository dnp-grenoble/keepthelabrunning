In order to set up CP, the things that you have to check in the beginning are:
1. Offset of the rare nuclei e.g. Carbon
2. Offset of the abundant nuclei e.g. Proton.
3. Spinning Frequency.

Spinning frequency is important because the matching condition for CP set up is:
$$ \nu_{1H} - \nu_{13C} = \nu_r $$

In the LAB sequence follwowing parameters are important.

- o1 : Put it at the centre of your $^{13}C$ spectrum.
- o2 : Put it at the centre of your $^{1}H$ spectrum.
