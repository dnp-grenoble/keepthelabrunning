**Some instructions about LAB Sequences**

- LAB sequences are tested, perfectly working and optimized​.
- The header of the file contains a short description​.
- All parameters are properly defined​.
- They are protections for irradiation time and duty cycle​.
- They use the LAB convention for reserved parameters​.
- By default, they have pre-saturation and echo detection (for DNP)​.

<span style="color:red"> Please do not modify the LAB sequences without asking Paul or Sabine </span>.

<span style="color:red"> Make a copy of the sequence if you intend to modify something </span>.


In these sequences some parameters are kept reserved
for certain purposes.

Here are some examples:
