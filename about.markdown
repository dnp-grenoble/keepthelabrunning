This website is intended to make life easier in the lab.
You will find manuals, instructions, and how to set up things in the lab.

If you think, anything else should be added to the website, please let me know.

Also, whilst following any instructions, you run into any sort of problem, do not hesitate to contact Paul, Sabine, or Gael.

Thank you for your cooperation!

Paul
